## MakeDataBaseFromKittiObjectDection.ipynb

Make data set from the ground truth.

## PretreatmentDataSetAndClassification.ipynb

* Pretreatment of the raw data, and build a PointNet++ to classify them. (Classfication precision reaches 90%)
* Implement the model to the whole KITTI set for detection task. (Traditional segmentation + Pointnet++ classification)

## ResultEvaluation.ipynb

* Analysis the results, show the recall and precision.
* What todo next.
